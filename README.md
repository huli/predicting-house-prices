# Advanced regression with ensembles and stacking

### Capstone Project of the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree

The project is a predictive model for a kaggle competition:

**House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques**

(https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

Data exploration and model definitions:
* **walkthrough.ipynb** _(Process of exploration and first models)_
* **benchmark_model.ipynb** _(Benchmark model for comparison)_
* **neural_network.ipynb** _(Neural Network with KerasRegressor)_
* **stacking_with_nn.ipynb** _(Stacking model with blending)_
* **final_model.ipynb** _(Final model for submission)_

Data files:
* data\train.csv _(Complete training set)_
* data\test.csv _(Testing set for submission)_

Supplementary files
* unrefined\features_engineering.ipynb
* unrefined\stacking_with_regressors.ipynb

_(Required is nothing more than common data science and machine learning 
libraries like (numpy, scipy, sklearn, xgboost eg.))_
